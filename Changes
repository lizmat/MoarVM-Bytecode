{{$NEXT}}

0.0.8  2024-04-18T22:56:28+02:00
    - Only add "Statement" objects if the bytecode offset is different
    - Provide basic "gist" support

0.0.7  2024-04-18T13:16:30+02:00
    - Rename "annotation-offset" and "annotation-length" methods on
      the "Bytecode" object to "annotation-data-offset" and
      "annotation-data-offset" to avoid confusion with similarly
      named methods on the "Frame" object
    - Reformat documentation a bit
    - Document method "uint16"
    - Add utility methods "uint16s" and "uints32" and document
      them
    - Remove attribute "name" from "Frame" class to be replaced by
      a lazily mixed in role method "name" if the object actually
      has a name
    - Add lazily mixed in role method "filename" to "Frame" objects
      if the object actually has a filename
    - Add class "Statement" to capture information about a statement:
      For now this will only "offset" and "line" methods
    - Add method "statements" to "Frame" class, containing the
      "Statement" objects of the frame.
    - Remove "annotation-offset" and "annotation-entries" methods

0.0.5  2024-04-17T12:22:35+02:00
    - Add "Frames" class to provide a lazy positional interface to
      frame information
    - Make frame reification lazy and abstract this into a "Frames"
      object
    - Add "reify-all" method to "Frames" object to reify all "Frame"
      objects that haven't been reified before, in a hypered way

0.0.4  2024-04-16T20:24:22+02:00
    - Simplify internal representation of "sc-dependencies"
    - Move documentation to separate file for convenience
    - Add level 7 bytecode documentation from MoarVM repo for reference
    - Add "str" utility method
    - Add "ExtensionOp", "Frame", "Local" and "Lexical" classes and a
      first stab at documenting them
    - Add instance method "extension-ops", a list of "ExtensionOp"
      objects
    - Add instance method "frames" returning a "Frame" object for
      each frame

0.0.3  2024-04-15T18:44:58+02:00

    - Replace class method "blib" by more general "rootdir"
    - Add class method "files" to produce all bytecode files of a
      Rakudo installation
    - Add dependency on "paths"
    - The "setting" method now searches for the bytecode file, to
      enable proper CI testing, which has a weird file layout
